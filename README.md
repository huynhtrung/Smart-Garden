## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatically records humidity and temperature values using sensors.
- **Web Dashboard**: Visualize live data, historical trends, and control connected garden devices.
- **Android App**: Provides on-the-go monitoring and control of your garden.
- **Remote Control**: Manage irrigation, lighting, or other connected devices remotely via the dashboard or app.
- **Scalable & Extensible**: Easily add additional sensors or control modules to your setup.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main layers:

1. **Hardware/Firmware**:
   - **Arduino + ESP8266**: The microcontroller (Arduino) reads sensor data and communicates over WiFi using the ESP8266 module.
   - **Sensors**: A humidity and temperature sensor (such as the DHT11 or DHT22) measures the environmental parameters.
   
2. **Backend & Web Dashboard**:
   - A backend server (developed in your preferred language/framework â€“ such as Node.js, Python, or Go) receives sensor data pushed via HTTP or MQTT.
   - A web dashboard then visualizes the data and provides control interfaces for the garden devices.

3. **Android Mobile App**:
   - A dedicated mobile application that connects to the backend, allowing users to monitor data and control the garden in real time.
